## Synopsis:

In a future where an A.I. is implanted in the mind at birth, privacy is a forgotten relic of the past. The protagonist, Hirohito, is a cynic to the bone, seeing the current world as nothing but a cheap knock off of what the world is supposed to be. He watches the people around him living their happy, hollow lives and feels nothing but contempt at how easily they allow themselves go with the flow, never bothering to question their place in the world. They’re NPCs, every last one of them. No, they’re worse - at least NPCs are only capable of being NPCs. These people throw their possibilities away, all so they can coast through life with minimal effort.

He can’t tolerate them, and it made living in that charade of a reality unbearable, so he decided he had to find happiness somewhere else. It would be in virtual reality that he would find a place where he could belong. A place that promised him more than the mundane, a place where he could live a life of his own choosing. A place that would allow him to be human. Ironically, he felt more alive in this simulated world than he ever had in reality.
